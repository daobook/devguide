"This document describes how to use Clang to perform analysis on Python "
"and its libraries. In addition to performing the analysis, the document "
"will cover downloading, building and installing the latest Clang/LLVM "
"combination (which is currently 3.4)."

"This document does not cover interpreting the findings. For a discussion "
"of interpreting results, see Marshall Clow's `Testing libc++ with "
"-fsanitize=undefined "
"<https://cplusplusmusings.wordpress.com/tag/clang/>`_.  The blog posting "
"is a detailed examinations of issues uncovered by Clang in ``libc++``."

#: ../../clang.rst:21
msgid ""
"Clang is the C, C++ and Objective C front-end for the LLVM compiler.  The"
" front-end provides access to LLVM's optimizer and code generator. The "
"sanitizers - or checkers - are hooks into the code generation phase to "
"instrument compiled code so suspicious behavior is flagged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:27
msgid "What are Sanitizers?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:29
msgid ""
"Clang sanitizers are runtime checkers used to identify suspicious and "
"undefined behavior. The checking occurs at runtime with actual runtime "
"parameters so false positives are kept to a minimum."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:33
msgid ""
"There are a number of sanitizers available, but two that should be used "
"on a regular basis are the Address Sanitizer (or ASan) and the Undefined "
"Behavior Sanitizer (or UBSan). ASan is invoked with the compiler option "
"``-fsanitize=address``, and UBSan is invoked with "
"``-fsanitize=undefined``.  The flags are passed through ``CFLAGS`` and "
"``CXXFLAGS``, and sometimes through ``CC`` and ``CXX`` (in addition to "
"the compiler)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:40

"A complete list of sanitizers can be found at `Controlling Code "
"Generation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-"
"code-generation>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:45
msgid ""
"Because sanitizers operate at runtime on real program parameters, its "
"important to provide a complete set of positive and negative self tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:48
msgid ""
"Clang and its sanitizers have strengths (and weaknesses). Its just one "
"tool in the war chest to uncovering bugs and improving code quality. "
"Clang should be used to compliment other methods, including Code Reviews,"
" Valgrind, Coverity, etc."

"This portion of the document covers downloading, building and installing "
"Clang and LLVM. There are three components to download and build. They "
"are the LLVM compiler, the compiler front end and the compiler runtime "
"library."

"You should never have to add the libraries to a project. Clang will "
"handle it for you. If you find you cannot pass the ``-fsanitize=XXX`` "
"flag through ``make``'s implicit variables (``CFLAGS``, ``CXXFLAGS``, "
"``CC``, ``CXXFLAGS``, ``LDFLAGS``) during ``configure``, then you should "
"modify the makefile after configuring to ensure the flag is passed "

msgid ""
"Because the installer does not install all the components needed on "

"suite. Two checkers are used - ASan and UBSan."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:156

"Because the sanitizers are runtime checkers, its best to have as many "
"positive and negative self tests as possible. You can never have enough "
"self tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:159
msgid ""
"The general idea is to compile and link with the sanitizer flags. At link"
" time, Clang will include the needed runtime libraries. However, you "
"can't use ``CFLAGS`` and ``CXXFLAGS`` to pass the options through the "
"compiler to the linker because the makefile rules for ``BUILDPYTHON``, "
"``_testembed`` and ``_freeze_importlib`` don't use the implicit "
"variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../clang.rst:165
msgid ""
"As a workaround to the absence of flags to the linker, you can pass the "
"sanitizer options by way of the compilers - ``CC`` and ``CXX``.  Passing "
"the flags though the compiler is used below, but passing them through "
"``LDFLAGS`` is also reported to work."

"Clang allows you to alter the behavior of sanitizer tools for certain "
