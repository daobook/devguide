"When you feel comfortable enough to want to help tackle issues by trying "
"to create a patch to fix an issue, you can start by looking at the "
"`\"easy\" issues`_. These issues *should* be ones where it should take no"
" longer than a day or weekend to fix. But because the \"easy\" "
"classification is typically done at triage time it can turn out to be "
"inaccurate, so do feel free to leave a comment if you think the "
"classification no longer applies."

"For the truly adventurous looking for a challenge, you can look for "
"issues that are not considered easy and try to fix those. It must be "
"warned, though, that it is quite possible that a bug that has been left "
"open has been left into that state because of the difficulty compared to "
"the benefit of the fix. It could also still be open because no consensus "
"has been reached on how to fix the issue (although having a patch that "
"proposes a fix can turn the tides of the discussion to help bring it to a"
" close). Regardless of why the issue is open, you can also always provide"
" useful comments if you do attempt a fix, successful or not."
