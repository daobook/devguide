"Further options for seeking assistance include the `python-ideas`_ and "
"`python-dev`_ mailing lists. Python-ideas contains discussion of "
"speculative Python language ideas for possible inclusion into the "
"language. If an idea gains traction it can then be discussed and honed to"
" the point of becoming a solid proposal and presented on python-dev.  "
"Python-dev contains discussion of current Python design issues, release "
"mechanics, and maintenance of existing releases.  These mailing lists are"
" for questions involving the development *of* Python, **not** for "
"development *with* Python."

"If you are comfortable with IRC you can try asking on ``#python-dev`` (on"

" developers, ranging from triagers to core developers, who can answer "
"questions about developing for Python.  As with the mailing lists, "
"``#python-dev`` is for questions involving the development *of* Python "
"whereas ``#python`` is for questions concerning development *with* "
