"When running Python's test suite, no warnings should result when you run "
"it under :ref:`strenuous testing conditions <strenuous_testing>` (you can"
" ignore the extra flags passed to ``test`` that cause randomness and "
"parallel execution if you want). Unfortunately new warnings are added to "
"Python on occasion which take some time to eliminate (e.g., "
"``ResourceWarning``). Typically the easy warnings are dealt with quickly,"
" but the more difficult ones that require some thought and work do not "
"get fixed immediately."

"If you decide to tackle a warning you have found, open an issue on the "
"`issue tracker`_ (if one has not already been opened) and say you are "
"going to try and tackle the issue, and then proceed to fix the issue."
