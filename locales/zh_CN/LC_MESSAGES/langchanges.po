"On occasion people come up with an idea on how to change or improve "
"Python as a programming language. This document is meant to explain "
"exactly what changes have a reasonable chance of being considered and "
"what the process is to propose changes to the language."

msgid "What Qualifies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:13
msgid ""
"First and foremost, it must be understood that changes to the Python "
"programming language are difficult to make. When the language changes, "
"**every** Python programmer already in existence and all Python "
"programmers to come will end up eventually learning about the change you "
"want to propose. Books will need updating, code will be changed, and a "
"new way to do things will need to be learned. Changes to the Python "
"programming language are never taken lightly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:21
msgid ""
"Because of the seriousness that language changes carry, any change must "
"be beneficial to a large proportion of Python users. If the change only "
"benefits a small percentage of Python developers then the change will not"
" be made. A good way to see if your idea would work for a large portion "
"of the Python community is to ask on :ref:`python-list or python-ideas "
"<communication>`. You can also go through Python's stdlib and find "
"examples of code which would benefit from your proposed change (which "
"helps communicate the usefulness of your change to others). For further "
"guidance, see :ref:`suggesting-changes`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:30
msgid ""
"Your proposed change also needs to be *Pythonic*. While only the Steering"
" Council can truly classify something as Pythonic, you can read the `Zen "
"of Python`_ for guidance."

msgid "PEP Process"
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:41
msgid ""
"Once you are certain you have a language change proposal which will "
"appeal to the general Python community, you can begin the process of "
"officially proposing the change. This process is the Python Enhancement "
"Proposal (PEP) process. :PEP:`1` describes it in detail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:46
msgid ""
"You will first need a PEP that you will present to python-ideas. You may "
"be a little hazy on the technical details as various core developers can "
"help with that, but do realize that if you do not present your idea to "
"python-ideas or python-list ahead of time you may find out it is "
"technically not possible. Expect extensive comments on the PEP, some of "
"which will be negative."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:52
msgid ""
"Once your PEP has been modified to be of proper quality and to take into "
"account comments made on python-ideas, it may proceed to python-dev. "
"There it will be assigned a PEP dictator and another general discussion "
"will occur. Once again, you will need to modify your PEP to incorporate "
"the large amount of comments you will receive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:58
msgid ""
"The PEP dictator decides if your PEP is accepted (typically based on "
"whether most core developers support the PEP). If that occurs then your "
"proposed language change will be introduced in the next release of "
"Python. Otherwise your PEP will be recorded as rejected along with an "
"explanation as to why so that others do not propose the same language "
"change in the future."

msgid "Suggesting new features and language changes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:73
msgid ""
"The `python-ideas`_ mailing list is specifically intended for discussion "
"of new features and language changes. Please don't be disappointed if "
"your idea isn't met with universal approval: as the long list of Rejected"
" and Withdrawn PEPs in the `PEP Index`_ attests, and as befits a "
"reasonably mature programming language, getting significant changes into "
"Python isn't a simple task."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:80
msgid ""
"If the idea is reasonable, someone will suggest posting it as a feature "
"request on the `issue tracker`_, or, for larger changes, writing it up as"
" a `draft PEP`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langchanges.rst:84
msgid ""
"Sometimes core developers will differ in opinion, or merely be "
"collectively unconvinced. When there isn't an obvious victor then the "
"`Status Quo Wins a Stalemate`_ as outlined in the linked post."

"For some examples on language changes that were accepted please read "
