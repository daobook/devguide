"python-dev_ is the primary mailing list for discussions about Python's "
"development. The list is open to the public and is subscribed to by all "
"core developers plus many people simply interested in following Python's "
"development. Discussion is focused on issues related to Python's "
"development, such as how to handle a specific issue, a PEP, etc."

"Python-ideas_ is a mailing list open to the public to discuss ideas on "

"Sometimes people post new ideas to python-list_ to gather community "

"The python-committers_ mailing list is a private mailing list for core "
"developers (the archives are publicly available). If something only "
"affects core developers (e.g., the tree is frozen for commits, etc.), it "
"is discussed here instead of python-dev to keep traffic down on the "
"latter."

"Python-checkins_ sends out an email for every commit to Python's various "
